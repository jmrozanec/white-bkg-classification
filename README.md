The following repository presents scripts used to analyze different ways to predict white background at images. We analyze different algorithms and deep learning architectures, comparing against some state of the art architectures used for object recognition (ImageNet challenge winners from past years).


With some simple DL architectures we achieve 98% accuracy with very short training times.
