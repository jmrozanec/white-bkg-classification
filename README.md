# White background classification

The following repository presents an images dataset as well as scripts used to analyze different ways to predict white background at images. We analyze different algorithms as well as deep learning architectures, comparing also against some state of the art architectures used for object recognition (ImageNet challenge winners from past years).


With some simple DL architectures we achieve 98% accuracy with very short training times.
